# URL Shortener and File sharing

#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/n9oz_E9DIsM

#### Description:

There maybe many URL shorteners projects out there, but i found it quite great to start with because the project require to include many technologies learned in the lecture like python, flask, bootstrap, storing database and user cookies ... which is really help me to dive in and understand more about apply these technologies to real life.

This app includes 2 parts: URL shortener and file upload into short URL
Both are great for sharing with friends
First you only need to input your desired URL you want to save for sharing/later uses
Then you input new easy-remember URL of your own
Click Shorten and voil√†, new URL has been created
Later when needed, just copy new URL and send it to your friends or public elsewhere
when they go to your link, it will redirect to original URL
All your new URLs are saved under cookies
Click it and it will also redirect to original URL
The second part is file sharing, which also under the form of new URL
Click Choose File to select any file that you want to share
Name of your new URL
And there you go: the new URL generated for sharing too!
Just share it to your friends and they can see your file, or new photos!
Whenever your input URLs that not exists yet, it will redirect to 404 page
Go back to home page and try again :)
That's it! thank you for watching! :)
